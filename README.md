The first number is clash ranking.
The second number is a number of clashes played.
The third one is the score that determines how cool you are.

In plans:
- Add clash info to the account page.
- Add clash info to the cards that are already included on the page. Like on the "friends" page.
- Make it pretty.
- Add cashing.
